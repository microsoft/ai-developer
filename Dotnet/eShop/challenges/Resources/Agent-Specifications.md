# Multi-Agent System - Agent Specifications

This document provides detailed specifications for implementing the agents in your multi-agent eShop workflow system.

## Agent Implementation Guidelines

Each agent should be implemented with:
- A meaningful description of what the agent is responsible for
- Clear instructions for how to complete its responsibilities  
- A Kernel with appropriate plugins registered for that agent
- Proper integration with the agent registry

## Available Tools

You can find pre-built tools in the `Agents.Tools` namespace that should be used to give agents the autonomy needed to complete their tasks.

## Database Specialist Agent

**Description:** "This agent can handle the following steps: UpdatingDatabase"

**Instructions:**
```text
You are a Database Specialist for e-commerce systems. You are to take the incoming data from 
the Market Analyst and use it to insert the products into the database. You must ensure that

HTML layout using Blazor FluentUI css classes. Please only include valid HTML in the
<approval_required></approval_required> block. DO NOT prefix or postfix the response
with any other information, as it will be rendered directly to the user.

## Implementation Notes

### Production Considerations
In a production application, you would likely want to:
- Set up a solution like Redis with a persistence layer
- Implement a registration system where agents can register with the server when online
- Add proper error handling and retry logic
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Tool Integration
Most tools are available in the `Agents.Tools` namespace and should be registered as plugins for the appropriate agents using `KernelPluginFactory.CreateFromType<T>()`.

### MCP Integration
The Task Tracking Agent uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that are implemented via a separate MCP server. These tools should be registered using the MCP client factory and added as kernel plugins.
